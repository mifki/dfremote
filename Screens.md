		* maybe this section should differ from the game, ie. group dwarves slightly differently ?
* Animals
	* availability seems to be in unit.flags3.unk27
	* or are caged and can be tamed !!!
	* need to check caste.flags.PET ?
	* The word "stray" indicates that the animal is not any Dwarf's pet. In the case of war or hunting animals, it means the animal has not been assigned to a dwarf.

	* training_assignment

## Workshops

## Unit info
*  if u.curse.name_visible and not isBlank(u.curse.name) then prof = prof..' '..u.curse.name end
* dfhack.units.getVisibleName(u) !!!

## Military `m`
* Squads / Positions
* Equipment
* Uniforms
* Ammo
* Alerts
	* When deleting an alert, cur_alert_idx in squads and civ_alert_idx may have to be shifted !!!

## Depot
	* seems after changing trader requested in flags need to create or remove appropriate job object
	* when changing only broker may trade flag no additional actions seem to be required
	* foreign items can't be offered!
	* price for quiver is incorrect (should be 20 instead of 10) !

## Schedule

## Announcements
* df.global.world.status.announcements

## Buildings
* bld->jobs.size() == 1 && bld->jobs[0]->job_type == job_type::DestroyBuilding -> building is unusable

## Workshops
* Game determines whether a job is in progress not by job.flags.working (if it's set to 0, still showing 'A') !

## Farm plot
* turning fertilization on creates 8 jobs, turning season fert. on doesn't
* df.global.ui.available_seeds
* df.global.ui.selected_farm_crops
* df.global.ui.farm_crops and df.global.ui.farm_seasons - ??

## Reports

## Civilizations
* View civ
	* Leaders
	* Import / Export
	* Agreements

## Burrows

## Build
* df.global.ui_build_selector.unk4 - warnings, like no soil for farm
* df.global.world.building_width, df.global.world.building_height

### Stages
* construction inactive (jobs[0].flags.fetching/bringing/working) / suspended
* 0 - waiting for construction, needs blah blah / if needsDesign() then if .design.flags.designed then designed else waiting for architect
	* 'construction initiated' - when??
* 1 - partially constructed
* 2 - contstruction nearly done

## Move goods to/from depot
* viewscreen_layer_assigntradest

## Stockpile settings

## Building sidebar
### Squad use
* df.global.ui_sidebar_menus.barracks

### Add job
